# nvms

Node Version for MS Windows.

Inspired by [nvmw](https://github.com/hakobera/nvmw)
and [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
(and of course [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) itself),
but totally rewritten using Microsoft Scripting Host.

## Installation

If you have `git` installed:

  * git clone https://github.com/ukoloff/nvms.git
  * nvms/setup

If you have got no `git` or don't like to use command prompt:

  * Download https://github.com/ukoloff/nvms/archive/master.zip
  * Start downloaded `nvms-master.zip` (in Explorer)
  * Click `setup.bat`
  * Windows will prompt to extract all files
  * Agree
  * Click `setup.bat` again

After installation you should close command prompt (if any) and open new one to use `nvms`.
